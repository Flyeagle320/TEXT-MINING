['\nI have seen a lot of movies in my time, made in a lot of different styles from different genres, from all around the world. I\'ve seen everything from the most mainstream movie imaginable to the most experimental. I can\'t even remember the last time I came away from a movie thinking that I\'d never seen anything like it. But that\'s how I felt after "RRR."This movie is so much. Its "much"-ness may be a turn off to some, and almost was for me. My wife and I nearly bailed at the 20 minute mark because the film is so over the top and ridiculous. But we got hooked, and then I was totally in for the ride, to the point where I was disappointed that this 3+-hour behemoth was ending.Do you like to see muscle-bound, slicked-up men fighting tigers? Check. How about public floggings that turn into musical numbers? Got it. Evil British people so extremely evil that England should sue the filmmakers for defamation? Sure. How about evil British people being mauled by rampaging jungle animals? You betcha. Beheadings? Yep. Romance? Of course. Homoeroticism so intense just watching this movie may turn you gay? Hoo-boy. Let\'s just say that anything not already in this movie isn\'t worth having anyway.Watch "RRR," and then make sure whatever the first movie is that you watch after it is one you don\'t care too much about, because it will most certainly feel like the palest imitation of a movie you have ever seen. Seriously, this movie is so deliriously bonkers and so unafraid to be absolutely absurd that it\'s almost impossible to watch pretty much any other movie now and not be disappointed by it for not being this one. Thanks a lot "RRR."Grade: A+\n\n                    28 out of 31 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

It's everything Marvel should have been.This movie is about 2 men, super human, some suspension of belief needs to be had. View it as a super hero movie and it delivers.Plot: It's about 2 men; a hero and the anti hero. One has duty, one has family.It's an action movie, think what Avengers Civil War, Batman vs Superman should have been. In modern American movies, the overuse of CGI makes the movies look cheap. RRR has CGI and some places it does look a little cheap, but for a modern big budget film, it delivers.I have to give it between a 9 and 10. My expectations were low, but the AMAZING actions scenes were filmed very well, the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well done.Highly recommended and a must see.\n\n                    77 out of 91 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

It took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film RRR, shoot and bring it to the silver screen. Pulling off a multi-starrer with Jr NTR and Ram Charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself. But Rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the story.RRR is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries - Alluri Seetharama Raju who waged an armed campaign against the British and Komaram Bheem a tribal from the Gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people. There is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but Rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meeting.RRR runs on a relatively simple premise. There's 'fire' - an angry, young police officer Ramaraju (Ram Charan) who is both revered and feared by the British. He has done their every bidding for years, he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet, he is the one who's never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin. Then there's 'water' - sweet, simple, innocent Bheem (Jr NTR) who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose. He's a Gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called Malli, who was taken away by Lady Scott (Alison Doody), to be the singing doll 'on (her) mantelpiece'. But that is just the beginning of the tale.Rajamouli's new calling cards seem to be building new world. Because, despite being based on two revolutionaries from history, RRR has a story that's completely fictional. Delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas. Bheem might have fought against the Nizams, so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the British that he's not to be taken lightly. But he also finds shelter with Muslims in Delhi. Ramaraju might seem like a well-trained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle (Samuthirakani) knows about. Scott (Ray Stevenson) might believe 'brown rubbish' deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but Jennifer (Olivia Morris) seems more empathetic. This is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek, this is the one where you use your hands as weapons.The first half of RRR runs like clockwork. There's the emotional core in Malli, there's the song and dance with Naatu Naatu (it'll make you smile) and a friendship explored through Dosti, there's even a few laughs whenever Bheem tries to befriend Jennifer. Cinematic liberties are taken but they don't seem as noticable as in the later portions, half where the film falters a bit. The way Ramaraju's fianc√© Sita (Alia Bhatt) is woven into the narrative, apart from Ram Charan's transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing. After the way Bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told, the way Ramaraju's story unfolds seems strained. The climax leaves more to be desired. The good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you. Rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverly.None-the-less Rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for - a commercial, action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained - which it does. The length also doesn't prove to be a hindrance, thanks to a tight screenplay. The VFX in certain portions could've been better. Jr NTR pulls off his career's best performance. He's charming as Bheem, especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find Malli comes through well, so does his love for Ramaraju. Ram Charan also does well, pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through. Tarak and Charan's roles require them to have chemistry, which they do. Alia Bhatt, Olivia Morris, Samuthirakani, Ajay Devgn, Shriya Saran and others play their parts well. Olivia in particular manages to win your heart. Alison and Ray breeze through their roles. Keeravani's OST for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the BGM. Senthil's camerawork is a delight too.RRR is made for a big screen viewing. The cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner. Oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from Rajamouli now. The background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition, unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself. It numbs us into submission but post-interval as the pace falters a little, the pleasures dwindle too.RRR is perfection by any means because after the way Rajamouli pulls off certain scenes, you wonder if he could've done a better job in others. But watch this one this weekend if you've been longing for a good action packed drama. Especially so if you're a fan of the lead duo.\n\n                    191 out of 275 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

It\'s certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former (well, duh, kids), but it also manages to be rapturously stupid it\'s gruesome violence than anything the latter would do. My wife with me also pointed out Zack Snyder but far superior visa vi "here\'s a man with something to say... and it\'s LOUD and SLOW MO" and I concur up to a point.

It\'s exhausting and crude and at times laughable (all those CGI animals oh my), and I had an absolute blast. You know what you\'re in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire. If you\'re not with it by then, leave and don\'t come back.I know this is not historically accurate (LOL), but who needs accuracy when the exploitation-meter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns? This is gloriously crazy but it\'s totally sincere. Oh, and Ray Stevenson: performance of his career!

But I can say that for large-scale, big-budget action movies, this is how you do it right. Hollywood isn't incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion, but many pale in comparison to RRR. Again without pointing out any movies in particular (because I don't know what's directly comparable), Hollywood should take notes.RRR has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epics/action movies, but it uses those tropes well. Things we've seen on-screen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if they're used properly, and RRR is a testament to that.The amazing action is probably what stands out the most, but at its core, this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated. There's some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie, but ultimately it's a good vs evil story that's pretty straightforward and honest about that, and thanks to the great characters and strong performances, that ends up being enough.There's very little by way of slow scenes or dead air, and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good. I complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot, and so I was really happy to find that RRR does its action so well. Amazing stunts, great setups for the big set piece scenes, a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat (but not too much that it feels gratuitous), and a way of making things over-the-top in the best way possible (so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys). The two main heroes in this are almost superheroes, which arguably makes RRR the best superhero film in years.Excellent stuff. A couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky English dialogue from the British characters is all I could criticise it for, and they're nitpicks. This is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime.\n\n                    22 out of 29 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker, RRR is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers, eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver: universal entertainment. RRR is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle, and experiencing it in 3D would only make it better. Ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences, RRR is epic in every sense of the word, and truly Ravishing, Refreshing and Recommendable.The film might be around three hours long, but it never actually feels like a long film. In fact, times flies by really quick while watching RRR, an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the U/A rating. The cinematography, the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film, aside from the terrific performances by Jr. NTR, Ram Charan and others. Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles. One more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun. And then, we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck, which is what any action buff could ask for.Plus, director S. S. Rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his film\'s two heroes, giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the "main hero". Also, the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings. Editing is razor-sharp and the sets look grand. RRR only reinstates the fact that S. S. Rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in India and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him. I would definitely recommend watching RRR and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end, otherwise you might miss some important parts. This is what cinema exists for, and you don\'t need to think too much before booking your tickets.\n\n                    73 out of 122 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The way it combined its own version of mythology and made it so good was something that really blew my mind even though I had so many issues during the modern times in that movie. But I could see that was some Telugu commercial filmmaking that was needed at that time. Then Eega with its crazy fly revenge felt even better. Then Bahubali became a national sensation but even though I liked that film, I was disappointed because I felt like Magadheera should have been the success Bahubali was. Other than the great war scenes and a few things here and there I didn\'t really like it as much as the previous two films I liked. Bahubali 2 was an even bigger disappointment as I didn\'t like it at all. So I was going into RRR with caution but it easily became my favourite film of his.Right from the start, with the intro of Ramcharan, there were many things about it that defied expectations. We see the hero of the movie in a completely negative light in an impossible action setpiece. The scene is crafted in such a way that even if we know that is not possible, we don\'t question it. The film is filled with so many moments like that where the action setpieces blow your mind and if these action scenes are shown any differently it would not work. The entry of Jr. NTR during the action scene right before the interval was another moment that was mindblowing.The use of patriotism and the mythological parallels were beautifully done. Even the wind rousing the character at a moment felt like it is referencing Bheem/Hanuman, the name and the action done by that character being sons of Vayu, the wind god in mythology. There are a lot of issues in the film, but the existence of this film in this form itself is a wonder as far as I\'m concerned. The best film to come out under the so-called "pan-Indian" label.\n\n                    57 out of 105 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

No, I\'m not talking about Akira Kurosawa\'s Japanese flick from 1963, but I\'m talking about SS Rajamouli\'s RRR. Actually, that\'s the best brief for the film I can think of. SS Rajamouli has been making mass-friendly commercial films for a long time, but Bahubali brought him pan-India popularity. He became a household name and a BRAND! So naturally, anything he would do after Bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too. The same happened with Prabhas when he came after Bahubali with "Saaho" and "Radhe Shyam". Let\'s just accept the fact that a film like "Bahubali : The Conclusion" (2017) can\'t be made again and again. Not just because it was a Massive Blockbuster, but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays. When I saw Bahubali 2, I called it the Greatest Commercial Entertainer of this millennium after Gadar (2001). Surprisingly, these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore+ tickets in the Hindi belt. It was acceptable to see such heroic characters in Bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period, which makes it reasonable. But with RRR, it can\'t be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century, where you expect some humanly possible stuff. It doesn\'t matter how big (fictionally) your character is, it has to make some sense when it comes to on-screen persona, as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period, who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood, and it all came with human restrictions. RRR looks problematic in that sense, but if you talk about mass cinema, then RRR is simply phenomenal.RRR is a fictional tale set in the 1920s. Two Indian revolutionaries, Rama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Jr. NTR), try to fight the mighty British Empire and Nizam of Hyderabad in their own ways, which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other. Bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by British officer Steve (Ray Stevenson) and his wife, Lady Scott (Alison Doody), while Rama is a British cop who tries to stop him. Two powerful heroes, one fiRe and one wateR, are pitted against each other, and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past events.RRR presents Ram Charan and Jr. NTR in never-seen-before avatars. Rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls. Ram Charan enters with a 5-minute long action scene, which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind, but that\'s what "mass cinema" means, right? On the other hand, Jr. NTR has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too. That entire forest sequence will blow your mind. A good happy warning to all Tarak fans: please keep your expectations high because Bheem is going to exceed all of them. The pair of Rama and Bheem work like a fireworks display during all those large-scale action sequences. Talking about the supporting cast, especially two Hindi actors, Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt, both have small but important cameos. Ajay Devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again, and in other news, the sky is blue. This man has some charisma of his own. It\'s only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly. Alia Bhatt as Sita looks gorgeous in every single scene, and her character plays a vital part in the narrative. Olivia Morris sparkles the screen with her beauty, and her accent is too cute. Alison Doody is the exact opposite of that, but that\'s what the villainous characters do. Both Samuthirakani and Shriya Saran appear in small roles, and both pass with good grades.RRR\'s basic script is as good as any Telugu action drama (mind you, some call it mindless), but the screenplay doesn\'t match that certain level you are expecting. The second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too. All those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the Big-screen extravaganza in 3D. The action sequences of RRR have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in India. Rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done Bahubali. That film still had battlefield references to help a bit, but RRR, despite being driven by two characters, provides a better visual spectacle than Bahubali. That\'s not a small thing, mind you. The music of RRR is going to create some hysteria in theatres. If you don\'t feel like dancing while "Naacho Naacho," I\'d say please consult a doctor. You are not normal. "Dosti" has got nice tunes for a situational song, and "Komuram Bheemudo" will take you all by surprise. I\'m not sure if you can hear "Raamam Raaghavam" clearly because there will be a lot of noise, including big screams and whistles, going around at the time. But you\'ll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching home.It\'s been more than two years since we haven\'t had a big pan-India event film and SS Rajamouli brings back that much needed "Big-Screen Experience" for us. Undoubtedly, the best director in India when it comes to commercial cinema. The name is SS Rajamouli! His extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in India. Bahubali was an ordinary script, but it\'s Rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film. No matter how many resemblances you find between it and "The Lion King" or its original source material, Shakespeare\'s Hamlet, it\'s a story every Indian can relate to. That\'s the same case with RRR, despite some flaws in the writing. But that\'s where Rajamouli\'s genius mind works overtime. He presents the high-octane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy. The hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too. Whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that pre-interval rampage or even that mind-boggling climax in the forest, SS Rajamouli has outdone himself. He has reached a level that other commercial directors in Indian cinema can never reach or even dream about. Give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it. That\'s what he has done with RRR. Every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas. Every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him. As a whole, RRR packs a solid punch of out-and-out commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the Bahubali juggernaut. Just don\'t mind the below average writing, and you are going to LOVE IT!RATING - 6/10*\n\n                    288 out of 597 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Raajamouli is the only director who can do this magic repeatedly.The 2 protagonists' best movie is also this one only, I suppose.Certainly like other films, there are some cons but the pros surpass them easily as it was a refreshing experience watching a nice masala movie after a long time.\n\n                    59 out of 114 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

However, I gotta give it to RRR for making it actually fun and exciting.Horrendous CGI aside, the dance scenes were super dope, especially that dance battle. Me and my boy actually wanted to give the dance a try. It won't be that good, but the point is that the actors were damn entertaining and amazing executing those moves.The action scenes were just as badass. It's so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that I loved it. It's basically a superhero movie. The two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining.The story itself was not bad, even though it dragged so much during the middle part. I was bored for a good chunk, waiting for more action scenes. The backstories didn't really add much to the present plot, even though they provided some more fun action. And of course, I didn't feel any emotional connection to any of the characters, as I just wanted this movie to be all about the over-the-top action.Overall, it's a highly entertaining movie that I had a great time even though there's still many problems with it. 7.5/10.\n\n                    11 out of 17 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

There were some boring scenes as well. Story is not so trong. VFX is good. Some section scenes are also good.

These days everyone doing based on someone life but from my side i have got only 3 hour to entertain myself and I can't regret for what i wasting my time. At this topic i only choose to entertain myself except to watch someone struggle in his/her time. I respect them all but i like to read a book about them not in film.Coming to the topic director did a brilliant job again and prove that he is the legend of indian cinema. Now some ppl will find logic, physic etc... Bcoz they don't know how to entertain themselves. Mostly from hindi audiences, by the way i m also a hindi but i like to praise someone hard work and any good films which entertain me anyway.\n\n                    55 out of 101 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

A straight and almost one line story with the two biggies made it easier. First half was very good even there was no such flaws of screenplay even the run time was almost more than 90 mins. The problem was the second half of the movie, which badly falls. In tha name of emotions they have poorly executed the screenplay which falls desperately. When it comes the vfx's(except animal effects) everything was visibly attractive. The fire and the water act for the actors worked very well in most of the aspects. The climax fight and the making was actually not satisfying when compared to the first half fight sequences. Overall a technicall strong with flaws in some vfx scenes and with the flawly writted second half, yes we can enjoy it once for the technical brilliance.\n\n                    41 out of 77 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?
